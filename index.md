# About ME

Hi, my name is Wai Taing Lam, you can call me ***Timothy***! I am a third-year transfer student at **Muir College**, majoring in **Computer Science**.

## Me as a programmer
As a CS major student, I enjoy programming a lot. I just finished a project that allow users to compress and uncompress text files on a web app by using `Huffman coding` I learned from CSE 100. The web app looks like this:
